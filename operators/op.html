    //the addition operator has 2 forms: binary and unary

    //binary + is for concatenating strings together
    //if number and string are added together, then the number becomes a string
    alert(2 + "1");

    //other operators work with only numbers and they always convert any strings to numbers
    alert(6 - "2"); //result is 4
    alert("6" / 3) //result is 2

    //the unary form of + converts variables to numbers if they are not numbers
    //it is the shorter form of the Number function 
    let x = 5;
    alert(+x); //no effect since x is already a number
    let y = true;
    alert(+y); //result is 1
    alert(+""); //result is 0
