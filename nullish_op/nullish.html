    //the nullish coalescing operator ?? provides a short syntax for selecting a FIRST "defined" variable from the list
    //in short, ?? returns the FIRST defined value

    //eg: a ?? b
    //the above result will be a if it's not null or undefined, b otherwise

    //the below code will show either the firstName, lastName, nickName, or the default string "Anonynous" if none of the variables are set
    let firstName = null;
    let lastName = null;
    let nickName = "Jamie";
    alert(firstName ?? lastName ?? nickName ?? "Anonymous"); //will display the value of nickName

    let height = 0;
    alert(height ?? 100); //result will be 0 because 100 is only returned if height is either null or undefined. Since height is currently equals to 0, hence 0 will be returned
